**Objective.**  
We quantify how habitat‐loss (HL) geometry alters realized habitat for consumers, measured as Biotically–Accessible Suitable Habitat (BSH). We explain geometry effects mechanistically with a BAM factorization: abiotic suitability \(A\), biotic support from prey \(B\), and movement/accessibility \(M\).

**Model.**  
We simulate a regular grid with a smooth climate gradient. A species pool is generated with body masses, basal/consumer status, climatic niche centers/breadths, and a metaweb linking consumers to prey based on body‐mass ratios. For a given landscape we compute:  
(1) climate pass \(Z\) (\(A\)-suitable cells for each species; threshold \(\tau_A\)),  
(2) biotic support \(B_{s,i}\) from the presence of at least one prey in cell \(i\) (saturating with exponent \(\gamma\)),  
(3) movement mask \(M_{s,i}\) by a component rule: within suitable kept cells, a cell counts only if it belongs to a connected component of size \(\geq T\) (4-neighbourhood). BSH for species \(s\) is the fraction of cells where \(Z \cdot B \cdot M\) allows occupancy above \(\tau_{occ}\) after assembly.

**Outcome & attribution.**  
We summarize per species the proxy  
\(F_s = A_s \cdot B_s^{\beta} \cdot M_s^{\mu}\)  
and show that \(\Delta F\) aligns with \(\Delta BSH\) across geometries (direction and rank). We decompose \(\Delta F\) into contributions of \(A,B,M\) using a midpoint (Shapley-like) split and, to remove unit-scale effects, compute **elasticities**  

\[
E_A = \frac{|\Delta A|}{\bar{A}}, \quad
E_B = \beta \cdot \frac{|\Delta B|}{\bar{B}}, \quad
E_M = \mu \cdot \frac{|\Delta M|}{\bar{M}} .
\]

Elasticity shares \((E_A,E_B,E_M\) normalized to sum 1) reveal which mechanism has leverage independent of raw scale.

**HL geometries.**  
We evaluate random loss (diffuse removals), clustered loss (seeded clumps), and front-like loss (a moving climate-like boundary) over loss fractions 0.2–0.8. For each of 18 scenario combinations (\(A \in \{neutral, intermediate, divergent\}\), \(B \in \{none, soft, strong\}\), \(M \in \{off, on\}\)) we average over pool and mask seeds.

**Key results.**  
(1) Clustered HL is primarily abiotic: it removes area but preserves connectivity; elasticity shares remain A-dominated.  
(2) Random HL becomes movement-driven beyond ~50–60% loss: the share of suitable cells meeting the component rule collapses and elasticity shifts toward M.  
(3) Front-like HL interacts with climate and diets: when climatic niches are divergent and diets narrow, biotic leverage rises (last-prey limitation along the climatic tail), even if raw \(\Delta F\) still looks A-dominated.

**Baseline indicators and phase rule.**  
From the baseline (no HL) we compute:  
\(D\) — climate divergence (tail contrast along the fitted climate axis);  
\(R\) — diet redundancy (mean prey per consumer);  
\(\Theta\) — movement stiffness = \(T / \text{mean number of climatically suitable cells per consumer}\);  
\(LPRI\) — tail-specific prey support (mean/min prey per consumer in the threatened tail).  

These indicators predict which geometry is risky. We then make the rule **loss-aware** using  

\[
CRI_{\ell}(f) = \text{mean}_s \, 1\big[ (1-f) p_{0,s} < p_c \big],
\]

with \(p_c \approx 0.593\) for 4-neighbour site percolation,  
and a basal-tail divergence \(D_{tail}\).  
Loss-aware predictions correctly flag Random as worst exactly when fragmentation thresholds are crossed.

**Management lens.**  
Elasticity shares provide a bang-for-buck compass:  
– high M-share \(\Rightarrow\) prioritize connectivity (component size, stepping stones);  
– high B-share \(\Rightarrow\) prioritize prey redundancy in the climate-threatened tail;  
– high A-share \(\Rightarrow\) prioritize area retention (compact reserves).  

The dashboard combines \(\Delta BSH\) curves (impact), fragmentation diagnostics (mechanism onset), and baseline indices with predicted ranking (anticipation).

**Robustness.**  
Signals persist under seed replication, front rotation (front effects weaken when misaligned with the climate axis), and metaweb rewiring placebo (biotic signals vanish as expected). \(\Delta F\)–\(\Delta BSH\) alignment is reported per geometry; where alignment weakens we report \(\Delta BSH\) without decomposition.

**Takeaway.**  
HL geometry matters mechanistically: diffuse loss triggers connectivity thresholds; climate-aligned fronts expose last-prey risks; clustered loss is mostly area. Our loss-aware indicators (\(CRI_{\ell}, D_{tail}, LPRI\)) allow managers to diagnose the dominant failure mode before loss occurs and to target interventions accordingly.

# Second Part
**Question.**  
How does the geometry of habitat loss (HL) change realized habitat for consumers, and which BAM mechanism—Abiotic (\(A\)), Biotic (\(B\)), or Movement (\(M\))—explains those differences in a way managers can act on?

**Realized habitat (BSH).**  
For each species we compute Biotically–Accessible Suitable Habitat (BSH): the fraction of cells that pass three filters.  
(A) Climate suitability: a Gaussian niche with center \(\mu\) and breadth \(b\), thresholded at \(\tau_A\).  
(B) Biotic support: at least one prey present in the cell, based on a metaweb built from body–mass ratios; support saturates with exponent \(\gamma\) so prey redundancy matters.  
(C) Movement/access: the cell belongs to a connected component (4-neighbors) of suitable, kept cells of size \(\geq T\) (the component rule). Assembly removes unsupported consumers iteratively; BSH is computed after assembly.

**Geometries.**  
We compare random (diffuse removals), clustered (clumps), and front-like (a boundary moves along the climate axis) loss over 20–80% loss, averaging across pool and mask seeds.

**Attribution.**  
We factor a smooth proxy  
\(F = A \cdot B^{\beta} \cdot M^{\mu}\)  
and show \(\Delta F\) aligns with \(\Delta BSH\). We then split \(\Delta F\) into \(A/B/M\) contributions and compute elasticities  

\[
E_A = \frac{|\Delta A|}{\bar{A}}, \quad
E_B = \beta \cdot \frac{|\Delta B|}{\bar{B}}, \quad
E_M = \mu \cdot \frac{|\Delta M|}{\bar{M}} .
\]

These identify the mechanism with leverage independent of raw units.

**Baseline predictors (insufficient).**  
A static movement stiffness  
\(\Theta = T / \text{mean suitable area}\)  
and a climate divergence index \(D\) from the baseline map did not predict which geometry is worst at moderate–high loss: they ignore the post-loss connectivity threshold and whether a climatic tail is actually removed.

**Loss-aware indicators (diagnostic before impact).**  
We introduce simple, map-based predictors evaluated at a target loss fraction \(f\):  
1. \(CRI_{\ell}(f) = P\big[(1-f) p_{0} < p_c\big]\), the share of consumers whose expected suitable fraction falls below the percolation threshold \(p_c \approx 0.593\) for a 4-neighbor lattice. High \(CRI_{\ell}\) flags fragmentation risk \(\Rightarrow\) random loss becomes worst.  
2. \(FTR(f)\), the fraction of a climatic tail removed by a front at loss \(f\) (using the fitted climate axis). High \(FTR\) means the front eats the tail.  
3. \(P_{\text{fail},90\%}\), the 90th percentile across consumers of the probability that no prey are present in the threatened tail at baseline (a last-prey risk). High \(P_{\text{fail},90\%}\) means the tail is biotically fragile.

**Phase rule (loss-aware).**  
If \(M\) is on and \(CRI_{\ell}(f)\) is high \(\Rightarrow\) random is worst (connectivity failure).  
Else if \(FTR(f)\) is high and \(P_{\text{fail},90\%}\) is high \(\Rightarrow\) front-like is worst (last-prey failure).  
Otherwise \(\Rightarrow\) clustered is worst (area-dominated).

**Results.**  
\(\Delta BSH\) curves show: clustered \(\approx\) abiotic (area), random becomes movement-driven beyond \(\sim 50{-}60\%\) loss (connectivity collapses), and front-like expresses biotic leverage when climatic niches are divergent and prey redundancy is low in the tail. The loss-aware audit correctly identifies random-worst regimes (\(CRI_{\ell}\)), and—when \(FTR \times P_{\text{fail},90\%}\) is high—flags front-worst regimes. Elasticity shares match these mechanisms: M-share rises under random at high loss; B-share rises under fronts with tail exposure; A-share dominates for clustered.

**Why this is not an artifact.**  
The fragmentation signal appears exactly when \(CRI_{\ell}\) crosses the percolation bound; the front signal requires both tail removal (\(FTR\)) and tail prey failure (\(P_{\text{fail},90\%}\)), and vanishes when the front is rotated off the climate axis or when the metaweb is rewired (placebo). \(\Delta F{-}\Delta BSH\) alignment is reported; where it weakens we rely on \(\Delta BSH\) only.

**Management lens.**  
Use the indicators before impact to pick the lever:  
– High \(CRI_{\ell}\) \(\Rightarrow\) invest in connectivity (component size/stepping stones).  
– High \(FTR \times P_{\text{fail},90\%}\) \(\Rightarrow\) buffer prey redundancy in the threatened climatic tail (tail-aligned corridors, basal protection).  
– Otherwise \(\Rightarrow\) maximize area retention in compact blocks.  

This turns HL geometry into a practical triage: diffuse loss triggers connectivity thresholds; climate-aligned fronts expose last-prey risks; clustered loss is mostly area.
