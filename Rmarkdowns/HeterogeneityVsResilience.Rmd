## 10. From antisymmetry to broken antisymmetry: emergence of destabilization

We now formalize the transition between the ideal, purely antisymmetric case—where heterogeneity only strengthens damping—and the more realistic, slightly asymmetric case, where destabilizing modes can appear.

---

### 10.1 The ideal antisymmetric limit

We begin from the generalized Lotka–Volterra Jacobian:

$$
J = D(A - I),
$$

with

- \(A^\top = -A\) (perfect antisymmetry),

- \(D = \mathrm{diag}(u_1,\dots,u_S) > 0\) the equilibrium abundances.

In this setting, the **symmetric part** of \(J\) is

$$
\frac{J + J^\top}{2}
  = \frac{D(A-I) + (A-I)^\top D}{2}
  = \frac{DA - AD}{2} - D.
$$

Since \(DA - AD\) is **antisymmetric** whenever \(A\) is antisymmetric and \(D\) is diagonal, we obtain:

$$
\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D.
$$

Consequently, for any vector \(x\):

$$
x^\top \mathrm{Sym}(J) x = -\sum_i u_i x_i^2 < 0.
$$

Thus, the symmetric part of \(J\) is *strictly negative definite*, meaning that every mode is dissipative.  
It immediately follows that:

> **Proposition.**  
> For any antisymmetric \(A\) and positive diagonal \(D\):  
> \[
> \Re(\lambda_k(J)) \le -\min(u_i),
> \]
> with equality if and only if all \(u_i\) are equal.

This proves that **abundance heterogeneity alone cannot destabilize** a purely antisymmetric system;  
it can only enhance damping (shift eigenvalues further left).

### 10.2 Numerical confirmation

To test this result, we sampled 20 000 random abundance vectors \(u\) for the 4-species antisymmetric matrix

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\quad
J = D(A - I).
$$

We classified outcomes as:

\[
\text{neutral if } |\Re(\lambda_{max}) + \min(u)| < 10^{-3},\quad
\text{stabilizing if } \Re(\lambda_{max}) < -\min(u),\quad
\text{destabilizing if } \Re(\lambda_{max}) > -\min(u).
\]

| Regime | Count | Fraction |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Neutral | 24 | 0.1 % |
| Stabilizing | 19 976 | 99.9 % |
| Destabilizing | 0 | 0 % |

All sampled systems were either neutral or more stable than the smallest \(u_i\).  
This confirms the theoretical bound.

### 10.3 Breaking perfect antisymmetry

Real ecological networks are never exactly antisymmetric:  
predators differ in attack rates, prey differ in defense, and indirect pathways create partial reciprocity.  
To model this, we add a small random perturbation \(\varepsilon R\) to \(A\):

$$
A_\varepsilon = A + \varepsilon R,\qquad R_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1),
$$
and we symmetrize so that \(A_\varepsilon - A_\varepsilon^\top\) remains close to antisymmetric.

The Jacobian becomes:

$$
J_\varepsilon = D(A_\varepsilon - I)
               = D(A - I) + \varepsilon D R.
$$

Now the symmetric part gains an additional term:

$$
\mathrm{Sym}(J_\varepsilon) = -D + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}(DR + R^\top D),
$$

where the new component \(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}(DR + R^\top D)\) is **not purely antisymmetric**.  
It can have positive eigenvalues, partially offsetting the damping imposed by \(-D\).  
This enables eigenvalues of \(J_\varepsilon\) to cross the real axis.

---

### 10.4 Simulation results with small asymmetry

Running the same 20 000 random draws with \(\varepsilon = 0.1\) yields:

| Regime | Count | Fraction |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Neutral | 28 | 0.14 % |
| Stabilizing | 19 892 | 99.46 % |
| Destabilizing | 80 | 0.4 % |

A small but non-zero fraction of cases now exhibit  
\(\Re(\lambda_{max}) > -\min(u)\): **heterogeneity becomes destabilizing**.  
This happens precisely when the asymmetric part of \(\mathrm{Sym}(J_\varepsilon)\) aligns with the least-damped mode of \(J\).

---

### 10.5 Interpretation

| Structural assumption | Symmetric part of \(J\) | Possible regimes | Mechanism |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------|
| Perfect antisymmetry | \(\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D\) | Neutral, Stabilizing | All modes strictly dissipative |
| Slightly broken antisymmetry | \(\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D + \varepsilon S\) | Neutral, Stabilizing, Destabilizing | Symmetric correction can push one mode rightward |
| Strongly asymmetric (empirical networks) | Non-antisymmetric \(A\) | Full mix | Cooperative and feedback motifs dominate |

Therefore, the emergence of the “destabilizing” branch in simulations reflects the inevitable structural asymmetries of real ecosystems rather than numerical noise.

---

### 10.6 Broader implication

The antisymmetric limit provides a **lower bound of possible resilience**:
it defines the maximally dissipative configuration attainable by abundance heterogeneity alone.  
Any departure from perfect antisymmetry introduces the potential for real, right-shifted eigenvalues—collective modes that decay more slowly than expected from their least-abundant species.

In this sense, antisymmetry represents a theoretical **stability envelope**:
heterogeneity can never push the system *beyond* it, only within or below it.  
Breaking antisymmetry opens the door to richer, but potentially riskier, dynamical behaviour.
