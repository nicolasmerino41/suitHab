# Analytical structure of antisymmetric Jacobians under abundance heterogeneity

## 1. Motivation

In generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) models, community stability is determined by the **Jacobian matrix** evaluated at equilibrium.  
Its dominant eigenvalue—the one with the largest real part—defines the system’s **resilience**, i.e., how fast perturbations decay.  
Understanding how this eigenvalue depends on **interaction structure** and **abundance heterogeneity** is key to linking network architecture to ecological stability.

Here we examine systems of the form

$$
J = D(A - I),
$$

where:
- \(A\) is the interaction matrix (\(A_{ij}\) measures the effect of \(j\) on \(i\)),
- \(I\) is the identity matrix (representing self-regulation),
- \(D = \mathrm{diag}(u_1,\dots,u_S)\) contains the equilibrium abundances \(u_i > 0\).

We will progressively build intuition about the structure of \(J\), starting from the basics.

---

## 2. The Jacobian of a generalized Lotka–Volterra system

The generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) equations are:

$$
\dot{u}_i = u_i [K_i - u_i + (A u)_i],
$$

where \(u_i\) is abundance, \(K_i\) the intrinsic productivity, and \(A_{ij}\) the interaction coefficient (positive for facilitation, negative for competition or predation).

At equilibrium (\(\dot{u}_i = 0\)), small perturbations evolve according to:

$$
\dot{\delta u} = J \delta u,
$$

where \(J\) is the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives:

$$
J_{ij} = \frac{\partial \dot{u}_i}{\partial u_j} = 
\begin{cases}
u_i A_{ij}, & i \ne j, \\
u_i(A_{ii} - 1), & i = j.
\end{cases}
$$

In matrix form:

$$
J = D(A - I).
$$

## 3. Self-regulation and relative interaction strengths

The subtraction of the identity matrix means that **self-regulation is fixed to unity**.  
Thus, off-diagonal interactions \(A_{ij}\) are *relative* to intraspecific self-damping.  
If \(A_{ij} = 0.1\), it means that species \(j\)’s effect on species \(i\) is 10% of \(i\)’s self-regulation strength.

---

## 4. Pure antisymmetry and its meaning

An **antisymmetric matrix** satisfies \(A^\top = -A\).  
This condition represents perfectly reciprocal pairwise interactions:

- If \(A_{ij} = a\), then \(A_{ji} = -a\).

Such matrices are central in predator–prey systems where the gain of one is the loss of the other.

In the antisymmetric case, \(A\) is purely rotational: its eigenvalues are purely imaginary, corresponding to neutral cycles in phase space.

---

## 5. Equal-abundance case (\(D = \bar{u} I\))

If all species have the same abundance \(u_i = \bar{u}\), then

$$
J = \bar{u}(A - I).
$$

The eigenvalues of \(J\) are simply \(\lambda_k = \bar{u}(\mu_k - 1)\),  
where \(\mu_k\) are eigenvalues of \(A\).

Since antisymmetric \(A\) has purely imaginary eigenvalues (\(\mu_k = i \omega_k\)),  
the real parts of \(J\)’s eigenvalues are all \(-\bar{u}\).

Hence:

> **Equal-abundance result:**  
> If \(A\) is antisymmetric and all abundances are equal,  
> then  
> \[
> \Re(\lambda_k) = -\bar{u} = -\min(u).
> \]
>  
> This is the “neutral center”: all perturbations decay at rate \(\bar{u}\) with oscillatory components determined by \(A\).

---

## 6. Unequal abundances and geometric distortion

When abundances differ (\(D \neq \bar{u}I\)),  
the Jacobian becomes

$$
J = D(A - I) = \bar{u}(A - I) + (D - \bar{u}I)(A - I).
$$

The second term distorts the pure rotation induced by \(A\):
each axis of the rotation (each species) is scaled differently.  
This distortion introduces effective symmetric components into \(J\) that can alter the real parts of its eigenvalues.

---

## 7. The 2-species analytical case

Let

$$
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
D = 
\begin{pmatrix}
u_1 & 0 \\
0 & u_2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Then

$$
J =
\begin{pmatrix}
-u_1 & u_1 \\
-u_2 & -u_2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The eigenvalues are:

$$
\lambda_{\pm} = -\frac{u_1 + u_2}{2}
\pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(u_1 - u_2)^2 - 4u_1u_2}.
$$

If \(u_1 = u_2 = u\), eigenvalues are \(-u \pm i u\).  
Otherwise, they are complex or real depending on heterogeneity.

Numerically:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\hline
$(u_1, u_2)$ & $\lambda_+$ & $\Re(\lambda_+)$ & $-\min(u)$ & Relation \\
\hline
$(1, 1)$     & $-1 \pm i$           & $-1$    & $-1$   & equal \\
$(1, 0.5)$   & $-0.75 \pm i\,0.66$  & $-0.75$ & $-0.5$ & more negative \\
$(1, 0.1)$   & $-0.55 \pm 0.32\,i$  & $-0.23$ & $-0.1$ & still more negative \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Numerical illustration of eigenvalue shifts for unequal abundances.}
\end{table}

So, **heterogeneity increases damping**:  
\(\Re(\lambda) < -\min(u)\) always.

---

## 8. Why this happens (proof)

For antisymmetric \(A\):

$$
\mathrm{Sym}(J)
  = \frac{J + J^\top}{2}
  = \frac{D(A - I) + (A - I)^\top D}{2}
  = -D + \frac{DA - AD}{2}.
$$

But \(DA - AD\) is antisymmetric when \(A\) is antisymmetric and \(D\) diagonal,  
so its symmetric part is zero:

$$
\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D.
$$

Thus, for any vector \(x\),
\[
x^\top \mathrm{Sym}(J) x = -\sum_i u_i x_i^2 < 0,
\]
proving that all modes are dissipative.  
No eigenvalue can cross the real axis;  
\(\Re(\lambda) \le -\min(u)\) for all \(u>0\).

---

## 9. The 3-species cyclic case

Consider the cyclic antisymmetric matrix

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Then \(J = D(A - I)\).  
For equal abundances,  
\(\Re(\lambda_{max}) = -1 = -\min(u)\).  
For heterogeneous \(u\),  
\(\Re(\lambda_{max}) < -\min(u)\), but never greater.

Hence, heterogeneity always *stabilizes or leaves stability unchanged*.

---

## 10. General result for perfect antisymmetry

> **Proposition.**  
> If \(A^\top = -A\) and \(D = \mathrm{diag}(u_i) > 0\), then
> \[
> \Re(\lambda_k(J)) \le -\min(u_i),
> \]
> with equality if and only if all \(u_i\) are equal.

This defines the **antisymmetric stability envelope**:
abundance heterogeneity can only strengthen damping, never weaken it.

---

## 11. Breaking perfect antisymmetry

Real ecosystems are rarely perfectly antisymmetric.  
Small deviations occur because interactions are not exactly reciprocal.  
We can write:

$$
A_\varepsilon = A + \varepsilon R,
$$
where \(R\) is a random matrix and \(\varepsilon\) controls the strength of asymmetry.

Then,

$$
J_\varepsilon = D(A_\varepsilon - I)
               = D(A - I) + \varepsilon D R.
$$

Now the symmetric part becomes:

$$
\mathrm{Sym}(J_\varepsilon) = -D + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}(DR + R^\top D),
$$

and the correction term \(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}(DR + R^\top D)\) can have positive eigenvalues.  
This allows one or more modes to drift rightward, producing *less negative* real parts—destabilization.

## 12. Numerical evidence

For \(S=4\), antisymmetric \(A\), and 20 000 random abundance draws:

| Case | Asymmetry | Neutral | Stabilizing | Destabilizing |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Perfect antisymmetry (\(\varepsilon=0\)) | 0 | 24 | 19 976 | 0 |
| Slightly broken antisymmetry (\(\varepsilon=0.1\)) | 0.1 | 28 | 19 892 | 80 |

Even a small deviation from antisymmetry yields a small but non-zero number of **destabilizing** cases.

---

## 13. Geometric interpretation

In the antisymmetric limit:

- Each 2×2 sub-block of \(A\) represents a rotation plane.
- The symmetric part of \(J\) is strictly \(-D\).

- All modes decay with rate at least \(-\min(u)\).


Breaking antisymmetry adds *shear* to these planes,  
partially converting rotational motion into stretching or contraction along real axes.  
When stretching exceeds damping in one direction, a destabilizing mode appears.

---

## 14. Synthesis and implications

| Structural assumption | Symmetric part of \(J\) | Possible regimes | Mechanism |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------|
| Perfect antisymmetry | \(\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D\) | Neutral, Stabilizing | All modes dissipative |
| Slightly broken antisymmetry | \(\mathrm{Sym}(J) = -D + \varepsilon S\) | Neutral, Stabilizing, Destabilizing | Symmetric correction introduces growth directions |
| Strong asymmetry (empirical webs) | Complex \(S\) | Mixed | Cooperative feedbacks can dominate |

Thus, the antisymmetric limit defines a **lower bound of possible resilience**:  
abundance heterogeneity cannot destabilize it.  
Destabilization only emerges once antisymmetry is broken,  
which happens naturally in empirical food webs with imperfect reciprocity.

---

## 15. Final conclusion

1. **Antisymmetric structure ensures strict damping**:  
   heterogeneity in \(u_i\) only strengthens stability, never weakens it.

2. **Breaking antisymmetry introduces instability potential**:  
   asymmetry adds symmetric components to \(J\), enabling eigenvalues to shift rightward.

3. **Empirical observation**:  
   most systems are near-antisymmetric and predominantly stabilizing,  
   with occasional destabilizing outliers arising from local structural imbalances.

4. **Conceptual takeaway**:  
   Antisymmetry defines the *theoretical stability envelope*;  
   real ecosystems fluctuate within and around it.

In summary:

> **Abundance heterogeneity alone cannot destabilize a perfectly antisymmetric system.  
> Destabilization arises only when antisymmetry is broken—  
> when feedback asymmetries inject symmetric components into the Jacobian.**
